          <h3>Why Coding?</h3>
          <p>
            If you view coding as another language you can communicate in, it
            really unleashes the power of this specialized skill set. It is
            where you can apply logic and reason to a complex problem, and watch
            you and your team create beautiful solutions. Want to help end
            homelessness? You can write code fro that.
            <br /><br />
            Want to make nights out with friends and family easier and more fun?
            The answer lies within the code. Don't believe me? Check out
            <i>Bridge The Gap</i> and <i>Night Out Roulette</i> in my "WORK" tab
            to see what I mean by coding being huge skill set in solivng
            problems.

          <h3>My Love for Project Management</h3>
          <p>
            No leader is self made, no innovator works alone, and no coder grows
            in isolation. True power comes from teamwork, and a team is only as
            strong as its lead. This is where my strenghts come into play - team
            management. This is an all-inclusive term: understanding the
            components of reaching a goal adn mapping out those steps against a
            plan, understanding your team and how they play into everything, and
            creating a motivaiting and healthy work culture.
            <br /><br />
            Need proof of my skill sets? <i>Bridge the Gap</i> is a project I am
            currently managing, and check out my resume to see my previous work
            experience.
